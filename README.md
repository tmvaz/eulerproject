# eulerproject (solutions)
This repository is based on a series of proposed solutions to the problems of Project Euler. (https://projecteuler.net)

The Euler Project consists of a set of mathematical problems where the player uses computational power to solve.

The repository is being fed as I progress with the solutions - feel free to correct potential errors or to optimize code.
